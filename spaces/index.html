<!-- Main Content -->
<section class="page-content">
    <div class="content-inner">

        <p class="lead">A room is never neutral. You knew this as a child. The basement that made your chest tight. The corner of the library where you could finally breathe. Your nervous system was reading the space before you had words for it.</p>

        <div class="whimsy-block">
            <img src="../img/gnomecatdoor.jpg" alt="A small door built for a cat" class="whimsy-image whimsy-image-lg whimsy-left">
            <p class="whimsy-caption">Sometimes a space needs another door.</p>
            <p>Most spaces are designed for function or aesthetics. I work on a third thing: <strong>how a space feels to the body inside it.</strong> This isn't mystical. It's just paying attention to what's already happening.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="whimsy-block">
            <img src="../img/trishade.jpg" alt="A triangular shade sail stretched between three trees" class="whimsy-image whimsy-image-lg whimsy-right">
            <p class="whimsy-caption">Sometimes the space needs both shade and a little shape.</p>
            <p>The height of a ceiling. The quality of light. Whether a hallway feels like an invitation or an ambush. These aren't just design choices—they're nervous system inputs. And most of us are walking through spaces that were never designed with our nervous systems in mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="whimsy-block">
            <img src="../img/sundeck.jpg" alt="A wooden deck extending outward with mismatched boards" class="whimsy-image whimsy-left">
            <p class="whimsy-caption">Sometimes the deck needs to be a little longer than the boards we have.</p>
            <p>I consult for retreat centers, festivals, workplaces, healthcare settings—anywhere that serves sensitive populations, or wants to. Sometimes that means a site report. Sometimes it means collaborating from concept through build. Sometimes it just means teaching people to see what was already there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <div class="whimsy-center">
            <img src="../img/hotair.jpg" alt="Colorful hot air balloons floating in the sky" class="whimsy-image whimsy-image-lg">
            <p class="whimsy-caption">Sometimes the space needs more whimsy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>What I Offer</h2>

        <h3>Site Consultations</h3>
        <p>I walk your space and deliver a report on flow, sensory load, rest zones, and regulation opportunities. This covers basics like replacing fluorescent lights, but also subtler aspects: airflow, use patterns, sources of frustration, and missed opportunities for peace. Recommendations range from adding plants and swapping a lightbulb to larger remodeling suggestions.</p>

        <h3>Design Collaboration</h3>
        <p>For architects, producers, and planners building something new, I consult on the somatic experience from concept through build. What I offer is simpler and less costly than an interior designer. Think of it as a sensory inspection. I notice irritants and disharmonies in a design and offer the easiest corrections.</p>

        <p>I've worked for years in construction, implementing designs built on computers by people with great vision but not always a close relationship with the materials themselves. Part of my neurodivergent superpower is feeling spaces before they're built, noticing what won't land right, and saving you thousands by catching it before it's too late.</p>

        <h3>Workshops</h3>
        <p>Teaching teams to see their environments through a nervous system lens, and to notice who gets heard in them. What if we reversed the usual power dynamics? What if the quietest voices, the ones who always acquiesce, had space to shape the room too?</p>

        <h2>Selected Work</h2>

        <div class="project">
            <h3 class="project-title">Balloon River</h3>
            <p class="project-location">Private Party, Berkeley</p>
            
            <div class="project-images">
                <img src="/img/balloon-river-1.jpg" alt="Illuminated balloon river installation filling a warehouse hallway with soft lavender and purple light">
                <img src="/img/balloon-river-2.jpg" alt="Detail of balloon clouds with LED chase lighting creating a flowing water effect">
            </div>
            
            <p>A long hallway in a comercial venue—high ceilings, hard surfaces, noise bouncing everywhere. The space needed to feel intimate, not industrial.</p>
            
            <p>I designed an overhead river of illuminated balloons that ran the length of the hall. Lavender, magenta, and purple. LED strips with a slow chase effect created the sensation of water flowing overhead.</p>
            
            <p>The installation did several things at once: it lowered the perceived ceiling, absorbing sound and softening the acoustics. It cast a gentle, diffused light that was easy on the eyes. And it transformed a transitional corridor into a destination—a place people wanted to linger. The effect was whimsy and wonder, a feeling of being held under something soft and alive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3 class="project-title">Outdoor Meeting Space</h3>
            <p class="project-location">NGO Headquarters, Nepal</p>
            
            <div class="project-images">
                <img src="/img/nepal-seatbacks.jpg" alt="Low bamboo wall surrounding an outdoor meeting space with carpets and cushions">
                <img src="/img/nepal-teaching.jpg" alt="Group gathered in the outdoor meeting space during a teaching session">
            </div>
            
            <p>We needed a gathering space that was outdoors but contained. Somewhere a team could meet, work, and teach without sitting in the dirt.</p>
            
            <p>I designed a low bamboo wall that encircled the space—just high enough to offer seatbacks for those sitting on the ground, and to keep dust out so we could lay down tarps and carpet. The structure was cheap, fast to build, and used the bare minimum material to achieve the necessary function.</p>
            
            <p>What we got was an outdoor living room. A place that felt held without being enclosed. The teaching space had its own ceiling and walls—an office that breathed.</p>
