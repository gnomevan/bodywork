        <p>You've tried everything for those chronically tight shoulders, neck, or hips. The massage that felt good but didn't last. The stretching that never quite reaches it. The tension that returns by morning.</p>

        <p class="lead">Some tension doesn't respond to pressure. It's not stuck—it's protecting. And it won't release until it feels safe.</p>

        <p>You know this tension. Shoulders hunched like a cat who heard something. Neck braced for a blow that isn't coming. It won't unlearn through force.</p>

        <p>What works is being met. Two nervous systems acknowledging each other's sovereignty. <span class="poetic">I see you seeing me. We are here together.</span> From that trust, new patterns become possible.</p>

        <h2>What My Sessions Are Like</h2>

        <p>This modality is like a dance, but you're relaxed on the table. I gently lead parts of your body in safe but unexpected directions while you practice surrendering into fluid motion. Together these movements become a slow repetition of micro trust falls.</p>

        <p>I'm listening through touch for edges where protection begins, waiting until your system decides it's safe to soften. We dance on these edges until they expand.</p>

        <p>What people notice most is being met—really listened to. Afterward, something settles. The body stops holding itself together so tightly. One client described it as feeling herself fall into alignment.</p>

                <h2>The Approach</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most tension is protective, not mechanical—it needs safety, not force</li>
                    <li>Your attention is required at first; once trust builds, you can relax into ease</li>
                    <li>No lotion or oil; wear thin, comfortable clothing</li>
                    <li>I work on joints, attachment points, and holding patterns—not muscle tissue</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>This Is For You If</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chronic tension that doesn't respond to typical massage</li>
                    <li>You identify as sensitive, neurodivergent, autistic, or ADHD</li>
                    <li>You need attunement to feel safe</li>
                    <li>You want slowness, or deep pressure approached gradually</li>

            <blockquote class="testimonial">
                <p>"Evan is an attuned worker of the subtle, slow realms. He holds a tender and compassionate space, one in which the body and nervous system's capacity to heal itself re-emerges. I came in a bit bound up, I'm used to people working on my body and trying to fix the many tangled places that are really just emotional knots, scared places wanting to remember safety.</p>
                <p>My experience with Evan was different—I could feel the subtle connections deep in my body weaving together, a touch that was listening to me, meeting me, helping me feel myself and also feel the calm and the letting go that was possible again.</p>
                <p>I left feeling my nervous system continue to integrate. It was an opening back into grounding and widening… it was safe to open and it took no effort."</p>

            <blockquote class="testimonial">
                <p>"I went to see Evan because I had ongoing tension in my neck and upper body, plus low back pain that usually shows up when I'm on my feet for a while. The session ended up being unlike anything I've experienced before—in the best way.</p>
                <p>Evan has this presence that's both gentle and steady. I felt really held, safe, and comfortable from the start. At some point I relaxed so deeply that I fell asleep.</p>
                <p>The biggest surprise was my low back pain disappearing after the session. The next day I spent the entire day on my feet at work and had no pain at all."</p>
